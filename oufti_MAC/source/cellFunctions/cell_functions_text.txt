%% cellList new structure
% We needed a new way to store the cellList. It used to grow like nframes
% squared, which caused big problerms when it exceeded 2 Gb. Saving with
% -v7.3 was a workaround, but the files then became so huge that loading
% them took forever. After >500 frames or so the GUI became very
% unresponsive, tipping the scales toward changing the way cell data is
% stored internally.
%
% The cellList is now comprised of two components:
% 1) cellId  --  For a given element in meshData, what is the cell id at
%                    the frame of interest?
% 2) meshData    --  This stores all the information that used to be in the
%                    cellList, but without empty elements.
% Both components are now stored in cellList, which is in turn a structure
% now:
% cellList.cellId
% cellList.meshData
